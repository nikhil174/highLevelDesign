<!-- Reference: Key Network Buzzwords -->

**IP Address**: A unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network.
    - Example: 192.168.1.1 (IPv4), 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334 (IPv6)
    - Why it matters: Enables devices to locate and communicate with each other.

**DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses.
    - Example: Resolving www.google.com to 142.250.190.4
    - Why it matters: Makes the internet user-friendly and accessible.

**Protocol (Introduction)**: A set of rules that define how data is transmitted over a network.
    - Example: HTTP, TCP, UDP
    - Why it matters: Ensures reliable and standardized communication between devices.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
    - Example: Used for web browsing, email, file transfers.
    - Why it matters: Guarantees data arrives intact and in order.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A connectionless protocol that sends data without guaranteeing delivery or order.
    - Example: Used for video streaming, online gaming, VoIP.
    - Why it matters: Faster than TCP, suitable for real-time applications.

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: The protocol used for transferring web pages on the internet.
    - Example: Accessing a website via http:// or https://
    - Why it matters: Foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

**WebSockets**: A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    - Example: Real-time chat applications, live updates.
    - Why it matters: Enables interactive, real-time communication between client and server.

**Forward Proxy / Backward (Reverse) Proxy**:
    - **Forward Proxy**: Sits between client and server, forwarding client requests to the internet.
        - Example: Corporate proxy server for internet access control.
        - Why it matters: Provides anonymity, security, and content filtering for clients.
    - **Reverse Proxy**: Sits in front of servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend server.
        - Example: NGINX as a reverse proxy for load balancing.
        - Why it matters: Enhances security, load balancing, and scalability for servers.
