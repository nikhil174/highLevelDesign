**Cloud Computing**
- Definition: Delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software) over the internet (the cloud).
- Benefits:
  - Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down as needed.
  - Cost Efficiency: Pay only for what you use, no need for heavy upfront investment.
  - Accessibility: Access services and data from anywhere.
  - Reliability: High availability and disaster recovery options.
  - Maintenance: Cloud provider handles updates and infrastructure management.

**Logging & Monitoring**
- Logging: Recording events, errors, and information about system operations for troubleshooting and auditing.
- Monitoring: Continuously tracking system performance, health, and usage to detect issues and ensure reliability.
- Why important: Helps identify problems, optimize performance, and maintain security.

**Hashing & Consistent Hashing**
- Hashing: Converts data into a fixed-size numeric code (hash) for fast lookup and storage.
  - Analogy: Like assigning a code to each book in a library for quick shelving and retrieval.
- Consistent Hashing: A technique to distribute data across multiple servers so that minimal data is moved when servers are added or removed.
  - Benefit: Improves scalability and fault tolerance in distributed systems.
  - Example: Used in distributed caches and databases to evenly distribute keys.
